# Changelog

## v2.4.7 (2026-05-26)
- Release the PHP session lock in all 41 web service handlers immediately after capability checks. Moodle holds a per-user session lock for the entire duration of every PHP request; while one handler runs, every other AJAX call from the same teacher blocks on it. Symptom: "Unable to obtain lock for session id session_XX within 2 mins" surfaced from `save_grade` while autosave + student-switch were in flight. None of our WS handlers write to `$SESSION` after authentication, so `\core\session\manager::write_close()` runs as soon as `validate_context` + `require_capability` succeed. Concurrent AJAX from the same teacher (loadStudent → 6+ parallel WS calls; autosave during navigation) now executes in parallel instead of serializing.
- Slow-save instrumentation: `local_unifiedgrader_save_grade` now emits a `debugging()` warning when a single grade save exceeds five seconds, with cmid, userid, elapsed time, and the most likely culprit dimensions (adapter type, whether advanced grading was in play, feedback draft sizes). Visible only when developer debug is enabled, so it doesn't affect normal operation.
- Profile popout now offers a "Send mail" shortcut into `local_satsmail` when that companion plugin is installed. Previously the email line below the student's name was a plain `mailto:` link that opened the teacher's external mail client — useful, but it bypassed the satsmail audit trail and lost the course context. When satsmail is detected (presence check on its compose entry point, not a class autoload so it degrades cleanly when satsmail isn't deployed), the email line becomes a "Send mail" link that opens satsmail's compose flow with the course and recipient pre-filled. The student's email address remains visible on hover (and in the full profile view). When satsmail isn't installed the popout falls back to the existing `mailto:` behaviour.
- Fix the participants list showing "Graded" for a submission that has just been reverted to draft from the marking panel. `assign_adapter::resolve_status()` was returning `'graded'` whenever an `assign_grades` row existed, regardless of the underlying `assign_submission.status`. Reverting to draft flips the submission row to `draft` but deliberately leaves the grade row intact (so the teacher's previous mark is preserved for next time) — the participant pill then kept saying "Graded" while the marking-panel pill, which reads `submission.status` raw, correctly said "Draft". Two contradictory verdicts for the same student. The resolver now treats an explicit `draft` or `reopened` status as authoritative and only falls through to the grade-row check when the submission is still in a graded-or-submitted shape. Regression test in `tests/adapter/assign_adapter_test.php` (`test_get_participants_reverted_graded_submission_shows_draft`) pins the behaviour.

## v2.4.6 (2026-05-26)
- Validate marking-guide criterion scores against their allocated maximum. Previously a teacher could type any value into a criterion score input — entering 6 in a criterion allocated 5 marks would round-trip silently to the server, inflate the marking-guide total, and break the gradebook column with no warning. The score input now flags out-of-range values (negative or above the criterion max) inline with a red border and a "Score for "X" must be between 0 and Y" message; the save dispatch (manual click + debounced autosave) refuses to fire while any criterion is flagged. Validation also runs against server-supplied fills on initial render and on student switch so anomalies introduced by older grading paths surface immediately. Same logic applies to per-question marks in quiz manual grading mode (which routes through the same widget).
- Submission-comment notifications now respect group mode on group-aware activities. Previously a student posting a comment notified every user with `local/unifiedgrader:grade` on the activity, including teachers responsible for other groups (and any course-wide editing teacher). For SEPARATEGROUPS or VISIBLEGROUPS activities, the notification is now scoped to teachers who share at least one group with the student. When the student belongs to no group, or none of the matching teachers are in the student's group(s), fall back to the legacy "all graders" recipient list so the message never gets lost. New focused test suite `tests/notification/submission_comment_notification_test.php` (7 tests) pins down the routing for every combination of group mode + membership
- Fix multi-attempt assignment grading panel not refreshing when the teacher picks a different attempt from the attempt selector. The `loadAttempt` mutation fetched the per-attempt grade and feedback correctly, but `_renderGrade`'s "navigation-boundary" override-lock gating only treated *student-switch* as a fresh render — same student, different attempt counted as a non-navigation re-render and skipped the form-input writes. The grade input, rubric/marking-guide fills and feedback editor all stayed on the previously-shown attempt's values. The gate now keys on `(userid, attemptnumber)` together so attempt-switch triggers the same fresh-render path that student-switch does.
- Fix the "late submission" badge silently disappearing from the marking panel on assignments where the student started a draft on time but submitted after the due date. The badge logic was reading `state.submission.timecreated` (draft start) while the student-list red dot used the submission's `timemodified` (final submit) — same student, two contradictory verdicts. The marking-panel badge stayed hidden while the red dot still showed.
- Same root cause was masking the late-penalty badge for graded submissions: `_getLatePenaltyPct` suppressed the badge whenever `timecreated <= duedate`, so an assignment that was penalised at save time never showed a "-X% Late" indicator on the next visit. Returning teachers and moderators couldn't see at a glance that the grade had been reduced.
- Fix: each adapter (`assign`, `forum`, `quiz`, `bbb`) now surfaces a canonical `submittedat` field in `build_submission_data()` that matches the semantic it already uses for the islate flag in `get_participants()` — `assign` = final submit (`timemodified`), `forum` = first post (`timecreated`), `quiz` = attempt `timefinish`, `bbb` = 0 (no submission concept). The `marking_panel.js` late-indicator and penalty-badge logic now read this single field instead of guessing between `timecreated`/`timemodified`, so the student-list red dot and the marking-panel badge always agree. WS schema for `get_submission_data` extended to include `submittedat`.
- Fix the late-penalty *point deduction* not surfacing in the grade card when Moodle's core gradepenalty subsystem applies a late penalty. `assign_adapter::get_grade_data()` was computing `$stilllate` against `$submission->timecreated` (draft start) — same divergence as above, but on the server side. For an on-time-draft-but-late-submit assignment the check returned false, `$latepenaltypct` stayed null, the WS returned no percentage, and the client had nothing to render — so the grade card showed the raw rubric total with no indication that the saved/gradebook grade was actually lower. Teachers had to open the gradebook column to confirm the penalty existed. Now uses `$submission->timemodified` to match the student-list islate check and the new `submittedat` field; the `-X% Late` badge and the "Final grade after penalties" display both populate correctly.

## v2.4.5 (2026-05-20)
- Quiz "Post grades" now flips a narrow, well-defined slice of the quiz review-options matrix instead of leaving teachers guessing about which review settings change. Specifically: `reviewmarks`, `reviewmaxmarks`, AND `reviewoverallfeedback` (added — previously only the first two) for the `LATER_WHILE_OPEN` and `AFTER_CLOSE` timeframes. Every other review setting is left exactly as the teacher configured on the quiz Review options page — most importantly `reviewattempt`, which controls whether the student can open the attempt at all and is governed only by the teacher's manual quiz settings. This means a teacher who wants "marks visible, attempt hidden" can leave `reviewattempt` off and use UG to flip marks visibility on or off without UG ever revealing the attempt contents. Resolves issue [#13](https://github.com/SATS-Seminary/moodle-local_unifiedgrader/issues/13). The confirmation dialog and in-product quiz help section have been updated to describe exactly which review options UG touches and which it leaves alone
- Surface per-attachment plagiarism reports on graded forums in the marking-panel "Plagiarism" card, the same way assignment file attachments are listed. Forum post-body plagiarism continues to render via the existing inline post shields in the preview panel; the marking-panel card lists attachment shields only so there's no duplicate display. The card sits above the marking guide / rubric just like for assignments
- New `\local_unifiedgrader\event\feedback_viewed` event class, fired from `view_feedback.php` after the grade-released check passes. Analytics consumers (gradereport_coifish / local_coifish) can now measure student engagement with Unified Grader feedback alongside the native `\mod_assign\event\feedback_viewed` event — closing the visibility gap on UG-graded forums, quizzes, and BBB activities, which never emit `mod_assign` view events
- The event is naturally gated by the existing `enable_<modname>` admin setting and the grade-release check, so it only fires when the student is actually viewing feedback for an activity type the institution has enabled
- Fix the submission-comments chat bubble being injected into the news / announcements forum. Moodle auto-creates an Announcements forum on every course, but those aren't graded and never form part of the teacher / student feedback loop, so the chat affordance has no place there. The hook callback now skips the widget on `forum.type === 'news'`, and the `add_submission_comment` web service rejects calls targeting a news forum as defensive belt-and-braces in case a stale cache lets the JS slip through. New `local_unifiedgrader\forum_helper::is_news_forum()` helper shared by both call sites
- Any pre-existing rows in `local_unifiedgrader_scomm` against a news forum are left as-is by this commit; if you want them gone, run: `DELETE s FROM {local_unifiedgrader_scomm} s JOIN {course_modules} cm ON cm.id = s.cmid JOIN {forum} f ON f.id = cm.instance JOIN {modules} m ON m.id = cm.module AND m.name = 'forum' WHERE f.type = 'news'`

## v2.4.4 (2026-05-18)
- Fix the marking-guide total badge displaying floating-point summing artifacts when the teacher entered decimal scores — `4 + 3.8 + 4.1 + 2` was being shown as `13.899999999999999 / 25` instead of `13.9 / 25`. The total is now rounded at the source so any value derived from it (the badge, the grade input via `_computeRubricGrade`, the percentage display) stays clean
- Rounding precision follows the gradebook's per-item `decimalpoints` setting (the same one that governs gradebook column display), with a hard floor of 2 decimal places so fractional rubric scores aren't silently swallowed when the gradebook is configured at 0dp. No new plugin setting — the existing course-level gradebook config is the single source of truth. Surfaced into the serialised grading definition for all three adapters (assign, forum, quiz)

## v2.4.3 (2026-05-18)
### Grade reset escape hatches
- Typing `-` in the overall grade input now resets the grade to "no grade" — mirroring how Moodle's gradebook accepts `-` to clear a cell. Previously a lone `-` reached the `save_grade` WS as `NaN` and surfaced an unhandled PARAM_FLOAT exception. The grade input clears immediately, the manual-override lock drops, and the save sends `-1` (no grade) to the server. Any other non-numeric placeholder is normalised the same way as belt-and-braces against future regressions
- Typing `--` is a **deliberate reset**: same grade-clearing behaviour as `-` plus
   - removes any orphan submission row whose status is not `submitted` (i.e. one created by accidental teacher interaction with the marking panel, not a real student submission). Real submitted rows are left intact
   - clears any `grade_grades.overridden` flag on the gradebook entry, so the gradebook column reverts to ungraded rather than staying pinned to a previously-applied override (typical when `gradepenalty_duedate` or a manual gradebook edit had set it)
- The `-` / `--` semantics apply to **forums too**: forum_adapter previously routed null grades through the advanced-grading pipeline which would rewrite a freshly-computed grade back in, and never overrode the deliberate-reset method. Both paths now correctly null the `forum_grades` row (light reset) or delete it entirely (deliberate reset, plus gradebook override lift). The student's posts are never touched
- New `reset` boolean param on `local_unifiedgrader_save_grade` (default false, so existing callers are unaffected); the WS short-circuits to a new `reset_grade_and_submission()` adapter method when set. `clear_recoverable_gradebook_block()` was hoisted from `assign_adapter` to `base_adapter` so all adapters share it

### Retry document conversion
- New **Retry conversion** button on the previewer's conversion-failed overlay. When the document converter (Google Docs, unoconv, FlaskOffice, etc.) is offline, Moodle's `mdl_file_conversion` table caches the failure and subsequent preview requests hit the stale failed row rather than re-trying. The button drops the cached row server-side and re-fires the preview load, which triggers a fresh conversion attempt. Backed by a new `local_unifiedgrader_retry_file_conversion` web service that handles both regular file conversions and online-text PDFs (which cache in our own `local_unifiedgrader/onlinetextpdf` filearea instead)
- The button is laid out on its own line below the error message with `gap-3` breathing room from the error text — earlier draft had them inline which crowded the borders

## v2.4.1 (2026-05-12)
- Default group filter to the teacher's own group(s) instead of "All groups" — previously this only happened for users without the `moodle/site:accessallgroups` capability, so course managers and admins saw every group by default
- Persist the group filter selection per-activity, keyed by cmid, so it survives page refreshes. Backed by a new `local_unifiedgrader_save_preference` web service and a small `preferences_manager` helper around the existing `local_unifiedgrader_prefs` table (previously only the privacy provider knew the table existed)

## v2.4.0 (2026-05-12)
### Comment library
- **Quick-access pill scoping**: pills now show only system defaults plus tags actually attached to comments in the current course (or to universal comments). Previously every tag the teacher had ever created showed up regardless of which course they were grading in
- **Universal comments**: new "Universal" checkbox on the new-comment and edit-comment forms in the manage-library modal. Universal comments have an empty coursecode and are visible across all of the teacher's courses; their tags also appear in every course's pill row. A sidebar entry labelled "Universal" surfaces them as their own bucket alongside per-course buckets
- **Search box** in the manage-library toolbar — case-insensitive substring match on comment content, combined with the existing course and tag filters
- **Admin: manage comment library** — new admin tool at *Site administration › Plugins › Local plugins › Unified Grader › Manage comment library* lets managers curate system-default tags (previously hardcoded) and seed system-default comments visible to every teacher across every course. New capability `local/unifiedgrader:managesystemdefaults` (manager archetype by default). System defaults render with a yellow star badge in the teacher's library modal and a dedicated "System defaults" sidebar bucket; they are read-only for teachers
- **Proposal workflow for system defaults**: teachers can suggest one of their own comments for inclusion as a system default via a star icon on each card; an optional rationale is prompted. Submissions appear in a "Pending submissions" section on the admin Manage System Defaults page; admins approve (creates a system-default copy preserving system tags, leaves the teacher's original untouched) or reject with an optional reason. The proposer's card shows a "Pending review" badge until decided and a "Rejected" badge (with the reason as a tooltip) afterwards. Backed by a new `local_unifiedgrader_clibprop` table and `local_unifiedgrader_submit_library_proposal` web service
- New setting *Require approval for system-default suggestions* (default ON). When ON, the proposal queue behaves as above. When OFF, teacher suggestions are promoted immediately to system defaults, inheriting only system tags from the proposer's selection; the proposal row is still recorded with `status = approved` and `decidedby = 0` for audit
- Fix: manual grade override (or any standalone edit of the grade input) now triggers an autosave on focus-out. Previously the rubric body had a focusout-autosave listener but the grade input did not, so an override of the rubric-computed total silently vanished on the next student switch or refresh
- Fix: once a teacher manually edits the top-level grade input, subsequent rubric/marking-guide edits no longer overwrite the manual value. Previously every `input` event on a rubric score fired `_updateGuideTotal` which wrote the auto-computed total back to the grade input, silently reverting any override. The lock clears on student switch so the next student starts in auto-sync mode
- Add an **Override** indicator below the grade input — a yellow badge plus the rubric total and a *Reset to rubric total* link — that appears whenever the displayed grade differs from the rubric/marking-guide computed value. The badge persists across sessions so a returning teacher or moderator can immediately see that the score has been manually adjusted; clicking *Reset* re-syncs the grade input with the rubric and triggers an autosave

### Grading
- Cap the manual grade input at the activity's maximum mark. Previously a teacher could type 40 in a 20-mark assignment and the save would persist 40 (200%), which silently broke gradebook calculations. The grade input now shows an inline error and refuses to save when the entered value exceeds the max; the server-side web service throws `error_grade_exceeds_max` as a belt-and-braces check. Skipped for scale-based grading (dropdown can't exceed) and for quiz grades (question engine clamps separately). Extra credit is not currently supported

## v2.3.2 (2026-05-11)
- Fix marking-guide / rubric fillings silently failing to save when the gradebook entry for the student is overridden — most commonly caused by Moodle 5.0's `gradepenalty_duedate` plugin applying a late-penalty deduction, which leaves `grade_grades.overridden` set. With the flag set, `assign::grading_disabled()` returns true and `apply_grade_to_user` silently skips the entire advanced-grading save block: rubric fillings never reach `gradingform_guide_fillings` even though the grade itself appears to save. Recovery now uses `grade_grade::set_overridden(false, true)` (which also calls `grade_item->refresh_grades($userid)` to reconcile the gradebook cell) and trusts the clear function's boolean return — the previous `grading_disabled()` re-check returned a request-scoped cached value showing the flag still set, aborting recovery even after a successful clear
- Fix auto-save race that could wipe marks, remarks, and the grade after a teacher typed and clicked on blank space — replaces the per-field snapshot/timing-based protection (which depended on fragile browser focusout/relatedTarget signals) with a **navigation-boundary gate**: server values are applied to editable form inputs only on the initial render or when the active student changes; every other `grade:updated` watcher invocation leaves the DOM as the teacher last edited it. Derived displays (penalty badges, percentage, late indicator, total scores) keep updating freely. Belt-and-braces guard in `_updateFeedbackContent`: TinyMCE editor still refuses overwrite when it has focus
- Fix marking-guide score inputs silently persisting as 0 when the teacher's browser locale uses comma as the decimal separator: `<input type="number">` rejects period-decimal input in those locales, so "3.5" was being sent to the server as an empty string and stored in `gradingform_guide_fillings.score` (a NOT NULL number column) as 0
- Switch score inputs and the top-level grade input from `type="number"` to `type="text"` + `inputmode="decimal"`, and canonicalise comma → period on every keystroke so values round-trip correctly regardless of locale
- Fix `TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'innerHTML')` thrown by `comment_library_popout._renderTags` when the remark-textarea autocomplete calls `getComments()` before the popout DOM has been built — `_renderTags` and `_renderComments` now bail out cleanly when their containers aren't ready yet

## v2.3.0 (2026-05-09)
### BigBlueButton activity adapter
- Recording playback rendered inline in the preview pane via iframe to BBB's playback wrapper, with a fullscreen button and "Open in new tab" link
- Recording switcher ("All sessions" + one pill per recording) — clicking a pill loads that recording and pivots the Activity Points card to that session's metrics
- Activity Points card with chats, talks, raise hand, poll votes, emojis, and duration — aggregated across all sessions or filtered to a single session
- BigBlueButton's 0-10 Activity Score surfaced as a tile (averaged across sessions in the aggregate view, exact value in the per-session view)
- "View full analytics" button opens BBB's Statistics dashboard in a new tab — single button when there is one recording, dropdown when there are several
- "Did not attend" badge for students with no JOIN or SUMMARY logs (still gradeable)
- Group mode supported via BBB's native group filtering
- New `enable_bigbluebuttonbn` admin setting (default off)

### Companion-plugin integrations
- `bbbext_advgrd` — rubric / marking-guide definitions on a BBB activity render in the marking pane and save through the extension's grader pipeline (per-user evidence snapshot, gradebook passthrough, analytic sub-scores). Grading instance is reused across saves rather than minted fresh each time.
- Engagement metric fallback for missing analytics callbacks: parses BBB's Statistics playback page server-side and caches per-user metrics in a new `local_unifiedgrader_bbbeng` table. Triggered by a "Pull engagement data from BBB recordings" button in the engagement-pending warning.
- New web service `local_unifiedgrader_refresh_bbb_engagement` (requires `local/unifiedgrader:grade`).
- Engagement-pending banner is actionable: site admins see the exact admin setting to enable plus a deep link to the BBB plugin settings; teachers without site access see a softer message.

### In-product documentation
- New `?` icon to the right of the hamburger in the grading toolbar opens a dedicated help page in a new tab, deep-linked to the section matching the active activity type
- Covers every adapter (assign, forum, quiz, BigBlueButton), companion-plugin integrations (Byblos portfolio, `bbbext_advgrd`, `quizaccess_duedate`, `gradepenalty_duedate`, plagiarism plugins, TinyMCE recorder), cross-cutting features, admin settings, architecture, and troubleshooting
- Six inline SVG diagrams — adapter pattern, BBB engagement data flow, marking-guide save lifecycle, companion-plugin landscape, annotation flatten pipeline, auto-save state machine. No CDN dependency.

### Auto-save race fixes (affect all activity types, not just BBB)
- `_renderGuide` and `_renderRubric` switch from destructive `innerHTML = ''` rebuilds to incremental DOM updates: snapshot values at save dispatch, then on the post-save state refresh keep the focused field — and any field edited since the save fired — instead of clobbering it
- Same protection extended to the top-level grade input, scale dropdown, and TinyMCE feedback editor (`setContent()` calls during a state refresh now refuse when the editor has focus or contains unsent edits)
- Re-mark grade dirty after a reconciled refresh so the next focusout flushes a follow-up save
- Treat `focusout` with null `relatedTarget` as ambiguous (defer to a microtask and re-check `document.activeElement`) — fixes marking-guide values resetting when opening the comment library in WebKit/Safari
